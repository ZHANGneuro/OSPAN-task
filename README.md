This matlab-based script is a practice of the Operation Span Task (SPAN).

The structure of task is fully programmed but the times of presented
letters and equations were controled in this practice. 

In details:
1. Practice 1 contains 3 sets, representing 2,2 and 3 letters respectively.  
2. Practice 2 contains one set which shows 3 math equations.
3. Practice 3 contains 2 sets, each randomly represents either 3 or 7 math
4. math equtions and letters. 
5. finally, real task also contains 2 sets each randomly represents either 4
    or 6 math equations and letters.
6. Task result is saved in "result" folder with '.mat' extension.

 To perform and quit the script:

type 'ospan(Subject_ID)' in Matlab command window, ex. igt(1), igt(2)....or igt(n).
Once task starts, user is not able to quit the progarm, program can be quit by pressing 'ESC' in the end of task.
